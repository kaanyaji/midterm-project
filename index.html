            Dumaguete City, with my brother and the rest of my family. This is my first year at Silliman, 
            where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology. I didn't have much of a background 
            in coding and actually used to dislike it, but since my Senior High School strand was 
            computer-centered, I decided to continue with it in college. Now, I'm trying to get 
            myself into programming, and I enjoy coding in HTML and CSS.</p>
